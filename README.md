# Sorting Algorithms
A repository of sorting algorithms

## Motivation
I've needed a project that was computationally simple that allowed me to explore Python packages and practice keeping up a GitHub repository in a systematic manner. Taking some time out of the day to implement a sorting algorithm seemed like a safe and attainable enough project, so here it is!


## Structure
At the moment, each algorithm is 

## Going forward
- Choose a tool to do documentation for python
- Choose a formatting tool
- Choose a linter
- Choose a test suite
- Refactor existing code to work in a testing environment
